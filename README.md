# BDI plugin for Atto

This plugin enables the user to orient correctly part ot a text that is within a paragraph of a different orientation.
This will display RTL oriented text within LTR oriented paragraph and vice versa.
While in the editor, these area will receive a CSS style to indicate to the user the tag is in use.

**NOTE:**
In order for the Moodle's html sanitation process to accept and display the tag, a change _has_ to be made to support it.
See tracker issue https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-76203 for an example.

You can watch a video demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH2p8eKGZHY).
